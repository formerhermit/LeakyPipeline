                                STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths. Careers that fall into these categories are traditionally male-dominated. The term Leaky Pipeline was introduced as an analogy to explain the differences in gender representation in STEM fields across the entire pathway of training and employment, whereas previous work had focused only on discrete stages (Berryman 1983). The pipeline represents the education and career path for a STEM subject, and the areas in this pathway where the volume of female representation decrease are considered talent ‘leaks’. 
                                The Leaky Pipeline is a timeline of where women leave the STEM career pathway, beginning at early school age, through university, and on into stages of their career.

                                The aim of this project is to produce a more effective way of raising awareness of the problem of female talent loss in STEM fields than current text-based information. This will include the options available to organisations to contribute through initiatives. The proposed solution will be more than just an educational tool, the desired outcome being to equip people with the knowledge that changes in governance and organisational policy can help to redress the balance, and encourage them to apply this knowledge within their organisation. The proposed solution will take the form of a digital game where users can explore the issues faced by females as they progress through a STEM career pathway, from school age to career, with scenarios based on evidence drawn from literature, and feedback with “calls to action” when scenarios are completed. Information about the business value of having diverse teams will be given to ensure that players understand the business case for implementing initiatives.

                                <p>By clicking on pieces of the pipe, you will be asked to consider different scenarios which a woman might face on her STEM career pathway and how organisations can get involved to help.</p>
                                <p>Each scenario has three choices to solve the problem, but only one of them is correct.</p>
                                <p>By choosing the most effective solution you will 'fix' that piece of the pipe and gain a point. </p>
                                <p>if you choose a less effective method, then you will receive a leaky pipeline piece and gain no points </p>
                                <p>There are four questions, and 5 possible badges to win!</p>
